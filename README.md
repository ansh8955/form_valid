# React Form with Formik and Yup

## Overview
Formik is a popular form library for React that simplifies form management with robust validation, while Yup is a schema validation library used seamlessly with Formik to ensure data integrity and user input validation.

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to create a form in React using Formik and Yup with the following features:

1. **Email Field**: Requires a valid email format.
2. **Password Field**: Requires the password "rishiME@199".
3. **Submit Button**: Initially disabled, enabling only when both fields have valid input.
4. **Error Messages**: Displayed within the input fields for user guidance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- npm (version 6 or later) or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-formik-yup.git
   cd react-formik-yup

   Usage
The form includes two fields and a submit button:

Email: Enter a valid email address.
Password: Enter the password "rishiME@199".
Submit Button: The button is disabled until valid input is provided in both fields. Upon valid input, the button becomes enabled.
Form Validation
Email Validation: Uses Yup's string().email() to ensure the email is in the correct format.
Password Validation: Uses Yup's string().oneOf(["rishiME@199"]) to ensure the password matches the specified string.
Displaying Error Messages
Error messages are displayed within the input fields to guide the user on the necessary corrections.
